# autoloader
This script loads a text file  in a html page and updates it every few seconds 

Write file.txt with a 3rd party software every few seconds 

operation mode 1  
use song.html to look at the latest form of the file in a slightly stiled mode 
#to do find a way to truly style the text 


use a url instead of file.txt and use autoloader.html to se ethe updated file in a standalone page 
ofc u can also use the autoloader.html directly on the server but in that case useing a php call like file_get_contents would probably be more efficient
